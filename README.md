Groovify
========
As you may be able to hear on the name this is a Grooveshark(TM) desktop application built on Scirlors Grooveshark API and other APIs such as Bass.NET for sound engine.
If you wish to see my todos take a look here: https://trello.com/b/5EXJwr72/groovify
If you wish to browse the code, well take a look above the readme

If you wish to make a suggestion or maybe even contribute code I will much happily take a look and see what I can do and if i implement it. This also applies to the styling of the application as I have yet to decied what style I want, the earlier versions of it was light, then I went for a dark look for a while, now Im back to the light theme.
